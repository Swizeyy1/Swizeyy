# Voice Assistant (Python)

This is a personal AI voice assistant I built using Python.  
It can:
- Speak to the user
- Understand voice commands
- Tell the current time
- Search Wikipedia
- Play YouTube videos

## How I made it:
I used these libraries:
- `speech_recognition`
- `pyttsx3`
- `wikipedia`
- `pywhatkit`

I tried to make the code modular and simple enough to expand later.  
This is part of my journey into AI and Python projects.

## To run:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition wikipedia pywhatkit
python voice_assistant.py
